# Hirst-Colorgram-Art
A cozy fusion of code and colors — my first spot painting project using Python and hirst vibes!  Turn any image into a colorful spot painting using Python — my first visual art project!

# 🎉 My First Spot Painting with Python! ❤️‍🔥🎨

Hey there, curious coder!  
Welcome to my **first-ever Spot Painting project** — built with **Python, colors, and a whole lotta love!**  

Get ready to transform any image (starting with a cozy hearth!) into a stunning **dot masterpiece** using the power of code!

---

## 🖼️ What Is This?

This project extracts the **most beautiful colors** from a **hearth image** using `colorgram.py` and recreates it as a **spot painting** — just like modern art, but made with Python!

**Dot by dot, color by color,** your image comes alive in a whole new way!

---

## ✨ Highlights

- 🎨 **Extracts dominant colors** from any image
- 🐢 Uses `turtle` graphics to draw colorful dots
- 🔄 100% customizable — change the image, dot count, size, spacing, you name it!
- 🧠 Great for beginners — no advanced code required!

---

## 🌈 Your Turn to Create!

Want to make your own masterpiece?  
You totally can!

### Just follow these steps:
1. Replace my hearth image with **any image you love** (your pet, fav singer, anime wallpaper, YOU!)
2. Run the Python file
3. Watch your own **spot painting** get painted before your eyes!

> It's like having your own digital paintbrush — controlled by code!

## ⚙️ How to Run This Beauty

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SrinjoyeeDey/Hirst-Colorgram-Art.git
